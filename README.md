# rock-paper-scissors
Completing the rock paper scissors project in The Odin Project.
The task is to create a game of rock, paper scissors where the user will play against 'the computer' which is randomly generating a selection for each round of the game. There needs to be a running total for the scores of both the player and the computer and also the game will need to update with round winners text. When either of the players reach a score of 5 the game will need to declare a winner and the page being updated to show that winner.
This project will be utilizing: a small amount of css styling; MY FIRST PROJECT USING JS!!!; JS to have an incrementing and updating score counter; JS to handle each round to declare who wins.
