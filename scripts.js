// 1 Make a function for a randomly selected rock paper or scissors for the computer 
//(thinking to use Math.random with 0-33 -34-66 67-100 each being a corresponding selection)
// 2 Make a prompt to allow the player to select either of the three
// 3 Create logic for rock > scissors; scissors > paper; paper > rock;
// 4 Return if win or loss 
// 5 increments the score
// 6 repeat for another round (look up how to use loops)
// 7 when at 5 points declare winner
